Although, it is also apparant that this growth is temporary and that once a company gains enough traction, growth generally slows down. I wish to understand and quantify the nature of this relationship by comparing the revenue of the company with CAGR (compounded growth). I also wish to understand what sorts of metrics seem to be helpful for large companies to maintain growth- from employee count to where the company is based and so on. \n",
