## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our group hopes to use the data from the top thousand fastest-growing companies in Europe to determine what factors contribute to companies’ success. As our group contains mainly economics students, there is a common interest in finances and other economic factors driving business growth and success. A few of our group members are graduating soon, so our interest lies in understanding employment opportunities in large successful businesses to give ourselves the best chances after graduation. We are looking to answer questions around growth rate, sector, and employee numbers across the thousand companies; more specifically, how the number of employees affects growth rates and revenue within a company. We are also exploring if the founding year affects growth rate and revenue. Lastly, we can compare growth rates across sectors to see which sectors grew the fastest in the period included in the data. It will be exciting and intuitive to present our findings in a dashboard. We are already visualizing how our data can be shown in various graphs and charts. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is collected by the Financial Times, which analyzes the top 1000 fastest-growing companies in Europe. Statista chose the companies with the perspective of analyzing the impact of COVID during 2020. Regarding data collection, the FT advertised the project online and invited CEOs and CFOs of companies to certify figures from company databases and alternative public sources. The minimum requirements that companies had to participate in included minimum revenue figures, non-subsidiary status, and not excessively volatile share prices. The country is from the FT’s list of chosen European countries.

As such, the dataset features the following categories:
* Company name and founding year
* Company sector
* Founding year 
* The country company is based in
* The rank of the company in the respective years of 2020, 2021 and 2022
* Revenue of the company in the years 2017 and 2020, respectively
* CAGR (Compounded Growth Rate) of the company between 2017 and 2020
* Number of employees hired in 2017 and 2020, respectively
